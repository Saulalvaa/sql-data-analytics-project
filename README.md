## 📍 Project Overview
This project contains SQL templates and examples for:
- Quick data exploration
- Business performance tracking
- Trend analysis
- Data segmentation and reporting

The goal is to save time, promote SQL best practices, and make analysis more efficient.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Gain a clear understanding of your database structure, content, and key metrics before deeper analysis.

- **Database Exploration** – Inspect schemas, tables, and relationships.
- **Dimensions Exploration** – Analyze categorical fields for distribution and uniqueness.
- **Date Exploration** – Identify time-based patterns, seasonality, and data completeness.
- **Measures Exploration** – Summarize numerical metrics (totals, averages, extremes).
- **Magnitude Analysis** – Assess the scale of measures to guide aggregation and visualization.
- **Ranking** – Identify top/bottom N entities (e.g., products, customers).

---

## 📈 Advanced Analytics
Perform deeper analysis to uncover trends, performance patterns, and actionable insights.

- **Change-Over-Time Trends** – Measure growth, decline, and rate of change.
- **Cumulative Analysis** – Compute running totals, cumulative percentages, and progressive performance.
- **Performance Analysis** – Compare metrics against benchmarks, targets, or historical data.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis** – Evaluate category contributions to overall totals.
- **Data Segmentation** – Group data into cohorts or segments for targeted insights.
- **Reporting Queries** – Create output datasets for dashboards and BI tools.

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For
- **Data Analysts** – Ready-to-use SQL templates for frequent analysis needs.
- **BI Developers** – Reusable queries for dashboards and reporting pipelines.
- **Data Scientists** – A fast EDA toolkit before moving into modeling.

---

## 💡 Key Benefits
- Modular, topic-based structure for easy adaptation.
- Clean, well-commented SQL scripts that follow best practices.
- Covers both **quick exploration** and **deep business analysis**.
